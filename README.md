# Resume-Screening-App

### Dataset

Rows Information

* The data set is consists of 962 rows.

Columns information

The dataset is consists of 2 columns namely: Category and Resume.

1. Category: It represents the category or type of resume, such as "Engineering", "Marketing", "Finance", etc. It categorizes the resumes into different groups based on their field or specialization.

2. Resume: It contains the actual text or content of the resumes. It includes the details of the candidates' education, work experience, skills, achievements, and any other relevant information typically found in a resume.

### Objective:

The primary goal of the project is to automate the categorization of candidates into specific fields such as Engineer, Data Scientist, Java Developer or other relevant categories based on the content of their resumes.

### Here's why the Resume project is essential:

1. Efficiency: Traditional resume screening methods are time-consuming and prone to bias. ML and NLP algorithms can process a large volume of resumes quickly, allowing recruiters to focus their time and attention on more critical tasks, such as interviewing candidates.

2. Accuracy: ML algorithms can accurately extract relevant information from resumes, such as education, work experience, and skills, reducing the risk of human error associated with manual resume screening.

3. Scalability: As the volume of job applications increases, the manual screening process becomes increasingly challenging to manage. ML-based resume parsing systems can handle large datasets effortlessly, ensuring scalability as recruitment needs evolve.

4. Personalization: ML algorithms can be trained to recognize specific job titles, qualifications, and skills tailored to the needs of different industries and companies. This customization enhances the accuracy of candidate matching and improves overall recruitment outcomes.

Example: For instance, consider a company looking to hire a Data Scientist. By implementing an ML-based resume parsing system, the HR department can input specific keywords and criteria related to Data Science into the algorithm. The system then automatically scans through incoming resumes, identifies candidates with relevant experience in Data Science, and categorizes them accordingly. This streamlines the recruitment process and ensures that only qualified candidates are considered for the position.

In summary, the Resume project utilizing ML and NLP algorithms offers a transformative solution to the challenges associated with manual resume screening. By automating the analysis of resumes, organizations can save time, improve accuracy, and make more informed hiring decisions, ultimately driving business success.
